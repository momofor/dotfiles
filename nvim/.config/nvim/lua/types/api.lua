---                 • "editor" The global editor grid
---                 • "win" Window given by the `win` field, or
---                   current window.
---                 • "cursor" Cursor position in current window.
---
---               • `win` : |window-ID| for relative="win".
---               • `anchor`: Decides which corner of the float to place
---                 at (row,col):
---                 • "NW" northwest (default)
---                 • "NE" northeast
---                 • "SW" southwest
---                 • "SE" southeast
---
---               • `width` : Window width (in character cells).
---                 Minimum of 1.
---               • `height` : Window height (in character cells).
---                 Minimum of 1.
---               • `bufpos` : Places float relative to buffer
---                 text (only when relative="win"). Takes a tuple
---                 of zero-indexed [line, column]. `row` and
---                 `col` if given are applied relative to this
---                 position, else they default to `row=1` and
---                 `col=0` (thus like a tooltip near the buffer
---                 text).
---               • `row` : Row position in units of "screen cell
---                 height", may be fractional.
---               • `col` : Column position in units of "screen
---                 cell width", may be fractional.
---               • `focusable` : Enable focus by user actions
---                 (wincmds, mouse events). Defaults to true.
---                 Non-focusable windows can be entered by
---                 |nvim_set_current_win()|.
---               • `external` : GUI should display the window as
---                 an external top-level window. Currently
---                 accepts no other positioning configuration
---                 together with this.
---               • `style`: Configure the appearance of the window.
---                 Currently only takes one non-empty value:
---                 • "minimal" Nvim will display the window with
---                   many UI options disabled. This is useful
---                   when displaying a temporary float where the
---                   text should not be edited. Disables
---                   'number', 'relativenumber', 'cursorline',
---                   'cursorcolumn', 'foldcolumn', 'spell' and
---                   'list' options. 'signcolumn' is changed to
---                   `auto` and 'colorcolumn' is cleared. The
---                   end-of-buffer region is hidden by setting
---                   `eob` flag of 'fillchars' to a space char,
---                   and clearing the |EndOfBuffer| region in
---                   'winhighlight'.
---
---               • `border`: style of (optional) window border. This can
---                 either be a string or an array. the string
---                 values are:
---                 • "none" No border. This is the default
---                 • "single" a single line box
---                 • "double" a double line box
---                 • "shadow" a drop shadow effect by blending
---                   with the background. If it is an array it
---                   should be an array of eight items or any
---                   divisor of eight. The array will specifify
---                   the eight chars building up the border in a
---                   clockwise fashion starting with the top-left
---                   corner. As, an example, the double box style
---                   could be specified as: [ "╔", "═" ,"╗", "║",
---                   "╝", "═", "╚", "║" ] if the number of chars
---                   are less than eight, they will be repeated.
---                   Thus an ASCII border could be specified as:
---                   [ "/", "-", "\\", "|" ] or all chars the
---                   same as: [ "x" ] An empty string can be used
---                   to turn off a specific border, for instance:
---                   [ "", "", "", ">", "", "", "", "<" ] will
---                   only make vertical borders but not
---                   horizontal ones. By default `FloatBorder`
---                   highlight is used which links to `VertSplit`
---                   when not defined. It could also be specified
---                   by character: [ {"+", "MyCorner"}, {"x",
---                   "MyBorder"} ]
