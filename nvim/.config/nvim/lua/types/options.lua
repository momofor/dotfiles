-- 	The word list name must consist of alphanumeric characters, a dash or

-- 	A region name must come last and have the form "_xx", where "xx" is
-- 	the two-letter, lower case region name.  You can use more than one
-- 	region by listing them: "en_us,en_ca" supports both US and Canadian
-- 	English, but not words specific for Australia, New Zealand or Great
-- 	Britain. (Note: currently en_au and en_nz dictionaries are older than

-- 	A list of the number of spaces that a <Tab> in the file counts for,
-- 	separated by commas.  Each value corresponds to one tab, with the
-- 	final value applying to all subsequent tabs. For example: >
-- 		:set vartabstop=4,20,10,8
-- <	This will make the first tab 4 spaces wide, the second 20 spaces,
-- 	the third 10 spaces, and all following tabs 8 spaces.

-- 	Expression which is evaluated to obtain the proper indent for a line.
-- 	It is used when a new line is created, for the |=| operator and
-- 	in Insert mode as specified with the 'indentkeys' option.
-- 	When this option is not empty, it overrules the 'cindent' and
-- 	'smartindent' indenting.  When 'lisp' is set, this option is
-- 	overridden by the Lisp indentation algorithm.
-- 	When 'paste' is set this option is not used for indenting.
-- 	The expression is evaluated with |v:lnum| set to the line number for
-- 	which the indent is to be computed.  The cursor is also in this line
-- 	when the expression is evaluated (but it may be moved around).
-- 	The expression must return the number of spaces worth of indent.  It
-- 	can return "-1" to keep the current indent (this means 'autoindent' is
-- 	used for the indent).
-- 	Functions useful for computing the indent are |indent()|, |cindent()|
-- 	and |lispindent()|.
-- 	The evaluation of the expression must not have side effects!  It must
-- 	not change the text, jump to another window, etc.  Afterwards the
-- 	cursor position is always restored, thus the cursor may be moved.
-- 	Normally this option would be set to call a function: >
-- 		:set indentexpr=GetMyIndent()
-- <	Error messages will be suppressed, unless the 'debug' option contains
-- 	"msg".
-- 	See |indent-expression|.

-- 	    unix    <NL>
-- 	    mac	    <CR>
-- 	When "dos" is used, CTRL-Z at the end of a file is ignored.
-- 	See |file-formats| and |file-read|.
-- 	For the character encoding of the file see 'fileencoding'.
-- 	When 'binary' is set, the value of 'fileformat' is ignored, file I/O
-- 	works like it was set to "unix".
-- 	This option is set automatically when starting to edit a file and
-- 	'fileformats' is not empty and 'binary' is off.
-- 	When this option is set, after starting to edit a file, the 'modified'
-- 	option is set, because the file would be different when written.
-- 	This option cannot be changed when 'modifiable' is off.
