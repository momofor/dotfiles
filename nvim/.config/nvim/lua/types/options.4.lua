-- 	Set to zero to be able to close folds of just one screen line.
-- 	Note that this only has an effect on what is displayed.  After using

-- 	with a line number. Since one space is always between the number and
-- 	the text, there is one less character for the number itself.
-- 	The value is the minimum width.  A bigger width is used when needed to
-- 	fit the highest line number in the buffer respectively the number of

vim.wo.numberwidth = "4"

vim.wo.previewwindow = "false"
-- boolean	(default off)

-- 	having to calculate it yourself. Especially useful in combination with
-- 	other commands (e.g. y d c < > gq gw =).
-- 	When the 'n' option is excluded from 'cpoptions' a wrapped
-- 	line will not use the column of line numbers.
-- 	The 'numberwidth' option can be used to set the room used for the line

-- 	When a long, wrapped line doesn't start with the first character, '-'

-- 	This option is per window, so it is possible to edit mixed files
-- 	simultaneously, or to view the same file in both ways (this is

vim.wo.winhighlight = ""
-- number (default 0)
-- 			global or local to window |global-local|
-- 	The minimal number of screen columns to keep to the left and to the
-- 	right of the cursor if 'nowrap' is set.  Setting this option to a
-- 	value greater than 0 while having |'sidescroll'| also at a non-zero
-- 	value makes some context visible in the line you are scrolling in
-- 	horizontally (except at beginning of the line).  Setting this option
-- 	to a large value (like 999) has the effect of keeping the cursor
-- 	horizontally centered in the window, as long as one does not come too

-- 	The line will be broken in the middle of a word if necessary.  See
