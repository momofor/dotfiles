-- 			w	different width
-- 			f	different foreground color
-- 			b	different background color
-- 			a	different attribute
-- 			+	missing position in first file
-- 			-	missing position in second file

-- Search for regexp pattern {pattern}.  The search starts at the
-- 		cursor position (you can use |cursor()| to set it).
--
-- 		When a match has been found its line number is returned.
-- 		If there is no match a 0 is returned and the cursor doesn't
-- 		move.  No error message is given.
--
-- 		{flags} is a String, which can contain these character flags:
-- 		'b'	search Backward instead of forward
-- 		'c'	accept a match at the Cursor position
-- 		'e'	move to the End of the match
-- 		'n'	do Not move the cursor
-- 		'p'	return number of matching sub-Pattern (see below)
-- 		's'	Set the ' mark at the previous location of the cursor
-- 		'w'	Wrap around the end of the file
-- 		'W'	don't Wrap around the end of the file
-- 		'z'	start searching at the cursor column instead of Zero
-- 		If neither 'w' or 'W' is given, the 'wrapscan' option applies.
--
-- 		If the 's' flag is supplied, the ' mark is set, only if the
-- 		cursor is moved. The 's' flag cannot be combined with the 'n'
-- 		flag.
--
-- 		'ignorecase', 'smartcase' and 'magic' are used.
--
-- 		When the 'z' flag is not given, searching always starts in
-- 		column zero and then matches before the cursor are skipped.
-- 		When the 'c' flag is present in 'cpo' the next search starts
-- 		after the match.  Without the 'c' flag the next search starts
-- 		one column further.
--
-- 		When the {stopline} argument is given then the search stops
-- 		after searching this line.  This is useful to restrict the
-- 		search to a range of lines.  Examples: >
-- 			let match = search('(', 'b', line("w0"))
-- 			let end = search('END', '', line("w$"))
-- <		When {stopline} is used and it is not zero this also implies
-- 		that the search does not wrap around the end of the file.
-- 		A zero value is equal to not giving the argument.
--
-- 		When the {timeout} argument is given the search stops when
-- 		more than this many milliseconds have passed.  Thus when
-- 		{timeout} is 500 the search stops after half a second.
-- 		The value must not be negative.  A zero value is like not
-- 		giving the argument.
--
-- 							*search()-sub-match*
-- 		With the 'p' flag the returned value is one more than the
-- 		first sub-match in \(\).  One if none of them matched but the
-- 		whole pattern did match.
-- 		To get the column number too use |searchpos()|.
--
-- 		The cursor will be positioned at the match, unless the 'n'
-- 		flag is used.
--
-- 		Example (goes over all files in the argument list): >
-- 		    :let n = 1
-- 		    :while n <= argc()	    " loop over all files in arglist
-- 		    :  exe "argument " . n
-- 		    :  " start at the last char in the file and wrap for the
-- 		    :  " first search to find match at start of file
-- 		    :  normal G$
-- 		    :  let flags = "w"
-- 		    :  while search("foo", flags) > 0
-- 		    :	 s/foo/bar/g
-- 		    :	 let flags = "W"
-- 		    :  endwhile
-- 		    :  update		    " write the file if modified
-- 		    :  let n = n + 1
-- 		    :endwhile
-- <
-- 		Example for using some flags: >
-- 		    :echo search('\<if\|\(else\)\|\(endif\)', 'ncpe')
-- <		This will search for the keywords "if", "else", and "endif"
-- 		under or after the cursor.  Because of the 'p' flag, it
-- 		returns 1, 2, or 3 depending on which keyword is found, or 0
-- 		if the search fails.  With the cursor on the first word of the
-- 		line:
-- 		    if (foo == 0) | let foo = foo + 1 | endif ~
-- 		the function returns 1.  Without the 'c' flag, the function
-- 		finds the "endif" and returns 3.  The same thing happens
-- 		without the 'e' flag if the cursor is on the "f" of "if".
-- 		The 'n' flag tells the function not to move the cursor.

--
-- 		"dict" can have these members:

-- 		   "stoponexit", "cwd", "env"
-- 		   "callback", "out_cb", "err_cb", "exit_cb", "close_cb"
-- 		   "in_io", "in_top", "in_bot", "in_name", "in_buf"
-- 		   "out_io", "out_name", "out_buf", "out_modifiable", "out_msg"
-- 		   "err_io", "err_name", "err_buf", "err_modifiable", "err_msg"
-- 		However, at least one of stdin, stdout or stderr must be
-- 		connected to the terminal.  When I/O is connected to the
-- 		terminal then the callback function for that part is not used.
--
-- 		There are extra options:
-- 		   "term_name"	     name to use for the buffer name, instead
-- 				     of the command name.
-- 		   "term_rows"	     vertical size to use for the terminal,
-- 				     instead of using 'termwinsize'
-- 		   "term_cols"	     horizontal size to use for the terminal,
-- 				     instead of using 'termwinsize'
-- 		   "vertical"	     split the window vertically; note that
-- 				     other window position can be defined with
-- 				     command modifiers, such as |:belowright|.
-- 		   "curwin"	     use the current window, do not split the
-- 				     window; fails if the current buffer
-- 				     cannot be |abandon|ed
-- 		   "hidden"	     do not open a window
-- 		   "norestore"	     do not add the terminal window to a
-- 				     session file
-- 		   "term_kill"	     what to do when trying to close the
-- 				     terminal window, see |term_setkill()|
-- 		   "term_finish"     What to do when the job is finished:
-- 					"close": close any windows
-- 					"open": open window if needed
-- 				     Note that "open" can be interruptive.
-- 				     See |term++close| and |term++open|.
-- 		   "term_opencmd"    command to use for opening the window when
-- 				     "open" is used for "term_finish"; must
-- 				     have "%d" where the buffer number goes,
-- 				     e.g. "10split|buffer %d"; when not
-- 				     specified "botright sbuf %d" is used
-- 		   "eof_chars"	     Text to send after all buffer lines were
-- 				     written to the terminal.  When not set
-- 				     CTRL-D is used on MS-Windows. For Python
-- 				     use CTRL-Z or "exit()". For a shell use
-- 				     "exit".  A CR is always added.
-- 		   "ansi_colors"     A list of 16 color names or hex codes
-- 				     defining the ANSI palette used in GUI
-- 				     color modes.  See |g:terminal_ansi_colors|.
-- 		   "tty_type"	     (MS-Windows only): Specify which pty to
-- 				     use.  See 'termwintype' for the values.
-- 		   "term_api"	     function name prefix for the
-- 				     |terminal-api| function.  See
-- 				     |term_setapi()|.
--
-- 		Can also be used as a |method|: >
-- 			GetCommand()->term_start()
--- @return number
function vim.fn.term_start(cmd, options) end

-- Wait for pending updates of {buf} to be handled.
-- 		{buf} is used as with |term_getsize()|.
-- 		{time} is how long to wait for updates to arrive in msec.  If
-- 		not set then 10 msec will be used.
--
-- 		Can also be used as a |method|: >
-- 			GetBufnr()->term_wait()
--- @return number
function vim.fn.term_wait(buf, time) end

-- Get the amount of indent for line {lnum} according the lisp
-- 		indenting rules, as with 'lisp'.
-- 		The indent is counted in spaces, the value of 'tabstop' is
-- 		relevant.  {lnum} is used just like in |getline()|.
-- 		When {lnum} is invalid or Vim was not compiled the
-- 		|+lispindent| feature, -1 is returned.
--- @return number
function vim.fn.lispindent(lnum) end

-- Set a flag to enable the effect of 'autochdir' before Vim
-- 		startup has finished.
--- @return none
function vim.fn.test_autochdir() end

-- Characters in {string} are queued for processing as if they
-- 		were typed by the user. This uses a low level input buffer.
-- 		This function works only when with |+unix| or GUI is running.
--
-- 		Can also be used as a |method|: >
-- 			GetText()->test_feedinput()
--- @return none
function vim.fn.test_feedinput(string) end

-- Set the flag to call the garbagecollector as if in the main
-- 		loop.  Only to be used in tests.
--- @return none
function vim.fn.test_garbagecollect_soon() end

-- Get the value of an internal variable.  These values for
-- 		{name} are supported:
-- 			need_fileinfo
--
-- 		Can also be used as a |method|: >
-- 			GetName()->test_getvalue()
function vim.fn.test_getvalue(string) end

-- Ignore any error containing {expr}.  A normal message is given
-- 		instead.
-- 		This is only meant to be used in tests, where catching the
-- 		error with try/catch cannot be used (because it skips over
-- 		following code).
-- 		{expr} is used literally, not as a pattern.
-- 		When the {expr} is the string "RESET" then the list of ignored
-- 		errors is made empty.
--
-- 		Can also be used as a |method|: >
-- 			GetErrorText()->test_ignore_error()
--- @return none
function vim.fn.test_ignore_error(expr) end
