-- 		    char	character previously used for a character

-- 				count).
-- 			#	the number of the last accessed tab page (where

-- Return byte index of the {nr}'th character in the string
-- 		{expr}.  Use zero for the first character, it returns zero.

-- 		Composing characters are not counted separately, their byte
-- 		length is added to the preceding base character.  See
-- 		|byteidxcomp()| below for counting composing characters
-- 		separately.
-- 		Example : >
-- 			echo matchstr(str, ".", byteidx(str, 3))
-- <		will display the fourth character.  Another way to do the
-- 		same: >
-- 			let s = strpart(str, byteidx(str, 3))

-- <		Also see |strgetchar()| and |strcharpart()|.

-- 		Hash tables are represented as Vim |Dictionary| type with keys
-- 		converted to strings.
-- 		All other types are converted to string with display function.
-- 		Examples: >

-- Evaluate Perl expression {expr} in scalar context and return
-- 		its result converted to Vim data structures. If value can't be
-- 		converted, it is returned as a string Perl representation.
-- 		Note: If you want an array or hash, {expr} must return a
-- 		reference to it.
-- 		Example: >
-- 			:echo perleval('[1 .. 4]')

-- The result is a String, which is the contents of register
-- 		{regname}.  Example: >
-- 			:let cliptext = getreg('*')
-- <		When {regname} was not set the result is an empty string.
--
-- 		getreg('=') returns the last evaluated value of the expression
-- 		register.  (For use in maps.)
-- 		getreg('=', 1) returns the expression itself, so that it can
-- 		be restored with |setreg()|.  For other registers the extra
-- 		argument is ignored, thus you can always give it.
--
-- 		If {list} is present and |TRUE|, the result type is changed
-- 		to |List|. Each list item is one text line. Use it if you care
-- 		about zero bytes possibly present inside register: without
-- 		third argument both NLs and zero bytes are represented as NLs
-- 		(see |NL-used-for-Nul|).
-- 		When the register was not set an empty list is returned.
--
-- 		If {regname} is not specified, |v:register| is used.

-- Without an argument returns the name of the normal font being
-- 		used.  Like what is used for the Normal highlight group
-- 		|hl-Normal|.
-- 		With an argument a check is done whether {name} is a valid
-- 		font name.  If not then an empty string is returned.
-- 		Otherwise the actual font name is returned, or {name} if the
-- 		GUI does not support obtaining the real name.
-- 		Only works when the GUI is running, thus not in your vimrc or
-- 		gvimrc file.  Use the |GUIEnter| autocommand to use this
-- 		function just after the GUI has started.
--- @return string
function vim.fn.getfontname(name) end

-- The result is a String, which is the read, write, and execute
-- 		permissions of the given file {fname}.
-- 		If {fname} does not exist or its directory cannot be read, an
-- 		empty string is returned.
-- 		The result is of the form "rwxrwxrwx", where each group of
-- 		"rwx" flags represent, in turn, the permissions of the owner
-- 		of the file, the group the file belongs to, and other users.
-- 		If a user does not have a given permission the flag for this
-- 		is replaced with the string "-".  Examples: >
-- 			:echo getfperm("/etc/passwd")
-- 			:echo getfperm(expand("~/.config/nvim/init.vim"))
-- <		This will hopefully (from a security point of view) display
-- 		the string "rw-r--r--" or even "rw-------".
--
-- 		For setting permissions use |setfperm()|.
--- @return string
function vim.fn.getfperm(fname) end

-- The result is a Number, which is the size in bytes of the

-- 		If the size of {fname} is too big to fit in a Number then -2
-- 		is returned.

-- associated with window {nr}.  {nr} can be the window number or
-- 		the |window-ID|.
-- 		When {nr} is zero, the number of the buffer in the current
-- 		window is returned.
-- 		When window {nr} doesn't exist, -1 is returned.

-- Close popup {id}.  The window and the associated buffer will
-- 		be deleted.
--
-- 		If the popup has a callback it will be called just before the
-- 		popup window is deleted.  If the optional {result} is present
-- 		it will be passed as the second argument of the callback.
-- 		Otherwise zero is passed to the callback.
--
-- 		Can also be used as a |method|: >

-- 			Directory		"dir"
-- 			Symbolic link		"link"
-- 			Block device		"bdev"
-- 			Character device	"cdev"
-- 			Socket			"socket"
-- 			FIFO			"fifo"
-- 			All other		"other"
-- 		Example: >

-- <		Note that a type such as "link" will only be returned on
-- 		systems that support it.  On some systems only "dir" and

-- Open a popup window showing {what}, which is either:
-- 		- a buffer number
-- 		- a string
-- 		- a list of strings
-- 		- a list of text lines with text properties
-- 		When {what} is not a buffer number, a buffer is created with
-- 		'buftype' set to "popup".  That buffer will be wiped out once
-- 		the popup closes.
--
-- 		{options} is a dictionary with many possible entries.
-- 		See |popup_create-arguments| for details.
--
-- 		Returns a window-ID, which can be used with other popup
-- 		functions.  Use `winbufnr()` to get the number of the buffer
-- 		in the window: >
-- 			let winid = popup_create('hello', {})
-- 			let bufnr = winbufnr(winid)
-- 			call setbufline(bufnr, 2, 'second line')
-- <		In case of failure zero is returned.
--
-- 		Can also be used as a |method|: >

--- @return number

-- Returns the |jumplist| for the specified window.
--
-- 		Without arguments use the current window.

-- 		{winnr} can also be a |window-ID|.
-- 		With {winnr} and {tabnr} use the window in the specified tab
-- 		page.
--
-- 		The returned list contains two entries: a list with the jump
-- 		locations and the last used jump position number in the list.
-- 		Each entry in the jump location list is a dictionary with
-- 		the following entries:
-- 			bufnr		buffer number
-- 			col		column number
-- 			coladd		column offset for 'virtualedit'
-- 			filename	filename if available
-- 			lnum		line number
