-- 	CHAR	VALUE	~
-- 							*shada-!*
-- 	!	When included, save and restore global variables that start
-- 		with an uppercase letter, and don't contain a lowercase
-- 		letter.  Thus "KEEPTHIS and "K_L_M" are stored, but "KeepThis"
-- 		and "_K_L_M" are not.  Nested List and Dict items may not be
-- 		read back correctly, you end up with an empty item.
-- 							*shada-quote*
-- 	"	Maximum number of lines saved for each register.  Old name of
-- 		the '<' item, with the disadvantage that you need to put a
-- 		backslash before the ", otherwise it will be recognized as the
-- 		start of a comment!
-- 							*shada-%*
-- 	%	When included, save and restore the buffer list.  If Vim is
-- 		started with a file name argument, the buffer list is not
-- 		restored.  If Vim is started without a file name argument, the
-- 		buffer list is restored from the shada file.  Quickfix
-- 		('buftype'), unlisted ('buflisted'), unnamed and buffers on
-- 		removable media (|shada-r|) are not saved.
-- 		When followed by a number, the number specifies the maximum
-- 		number of buffers that are stored.  Without a number all
-- 		buffers are stored.
-- 							*shada-'*
-- 	'	Maximum number of previously edited files for which the marks
-- 		are remembered.  This parameter must always be included when
-- 		'shada' is non-empty.
-- 		Including this item also means that the |jumplist| and the
-- 		|changelist| are stored in the shada file.
-- 							*shada-/*
-- 	/	Maximum number of items in the search pattern history to be
-- 		saved.  If non-zero, then the previous search and substitute
-- 		patterns are also saved.  When not included, the value of
-- 		'history' is used.
-- 							*shada-:*
-- 	:	Maximum number of items in the command-line history to be
-- 		saved.  When not included, the value of 'history' is used.
-- 							*shada-<*
-- 	<	Maximum number of lines saved for each register.  If zero then
-- 		registers are not saved.  When not included, all lines are
-- 		saved.  '"' is the old name for this item.
-- 		Also see the 's' item below: limit specified in KiB.
-- 							*shada-@*
-- 	@	Maximum number of items in the input-line history to be
-- 		saved.  When not included, the value of 'history' is used.
-- 							*shada-c*
-- 	c	Dummy option, kept for compatibility reasons.  Has no actual
-- 		effect: ShaDa always uses UTF-8 and 'encoding' value is fixed
-- 		to UTF-8 as well.
-- 							*shada-f*
-- 	f	Whether file marks need to be stored.  If zero, file marks ('0
-- 		to '9, 'A to 'Z) are not stored.  When not present or when
-- 		non-zero, they are all stored.  '0 is used for the current
-- 		cursor position (when exiting or when doing |:wshada|).
-- 							*shada-h*
-- 	h	Disable the effect of 'hlsearch' when loading the shada
-- 		file.  When not included, it depends on whether ":nohlsearch"
-- 		has been used since the last search command.
-- 							*shada-n*
-- 	n	Name of the shada file.  The name must immediately follow
-- 		the 'n'.  Must be at the end of the option!  If the
-- 		'shadafile' option is set, that file name overrides the one
-- 		given here with 'shada'.  Environment variables are
-- 		expanded when opening the file, not when setting the option.
-- 							*shada-r*
-- 	r	Removable media.  The argument is a string (up to the next
-- 		',').  This parameter can be given several times.  Each
-- 		specifies the start of a path for which no marks will be
-- 		stored.  This is to avoid removable media.  For Windows you
-- 		could use "ra:,rb:".  You can also use it for temp files,
-- 		e.g., for Unix: "r/tmp".  Case is ignored.
-- 							*shada-s*
-- 	s	Maximum size of an item contents in KiB.  If zero then nothing
-- 		is saved.  Unlike Vim this applies to all items, except for
-- 		the buffer list and header.  Full item size is off by three
-- 		unsigned integers: with `s10` maximum item size may be 1 byte
-- 		(type: 7-bit integer) + 9 bytes (timestamp: up to 64-bit
-- 		integer) + 3 bytes (item size: up to 16-bit integer because
-- 		2^8 < 10240 < 2^16) + 10240 bytes (requested maximum item
-- 		contents size) = 10253 bytes.

-- 	Additionally, names given in 'fileencodings' and 'fileencoding' are
-- 	used.
-- 	Conversion between "latin1", "unicode", "ucs-2", "ucs-4" and "utf-8"
-- 	is done internally by Vim, 'charconvert' is not used for this.
-- 	Also used for Unicode conversion.
-- 	Example: >
-- 		set charconvert=CharConvert()
-- 		fun CharConvert()
-- 		  system("recode "
-- 			\ . v:charconvert_from . ".." . v:charconvert_to
-- 			\ . " <" . v:fname_in . " >" v:fname_out)
-- 		  return v:shell_error
-- 		endfun
-- <	The related Vim variables are:
-- 		v:charconvert_from	name of the current encoding
-- 		v:charconvert_to	name of the desired encoding
-- 		v:fname_in		name of the input file
-- 		v:fname_out		name of the output file
-- 	Note that v:fname_in and v:fname_out will never be the same.
-- 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
-- 	security reasons.
vim.o.charconvert = ""
-- string	(default "./tags;,tags")
-- 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
-- 	Filenames for the tag command, separated by spaces or commas.  To
-- 	include a space or comma in a file name, precede it with a backslash
-- 	(see |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes).
-- 	When a file name starts with "./", the '.' is replaced with the path
-- 	of the current file.  But only when the 'd' flag is not included in
-- 	'cpoptions'.  Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  Also see
-- 	|tags-option|.
-- 	"*", "**" and other wildcards can be used to search for tags files in
-- 	a directory tree.  See |file-searching|.  E.g., "/lib/**/tags" will
-- 	find all files named "tags" below "/lib".  The filename itself cannot
-- 	contain wildcards, it is used as-is.  E.g., "/lib/**/tags?" will find
-- 	files called "tags?".
-- 	The |tagfiles()| function can be used to get a list of the file names
-- 	actually used.
-- 	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
-- 	file names from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
-- 	uses another default.
vim.o.tags = "./tags;,tags"
-- string	(default "")
-- 			global
-- 	This option is a list of comma separated names.
-- 	These names are recognized:
vim.o.clipboard = ""
