-- 		  %%	the % character itself
-- 		  %p	representation of the pointer to the container
--
-- 		Conversion specifications start with '%' and end with the
-- 		conversion type.  All other characters are copied unchanged to
-- 		the result.
--
-- 		The "%" starts a conversion specification.  The following
-- 		arguments appear in sequence:
--
-- 			%  [flags]  [field-width]  [.precision]  type
--
-- 		flags
-- 			Zero or more of the following flags:
--
-- 		    #	      The value should be converted to an "alternate
-- 			      form".  For c, d, and s conversions, this option
-- 			      has no effect.  For o conversions, the precision
-- 			      of the number is increased to force the first
-- 			      character of the output string to a zero (except
-- 			      if a zero value is printed with an explicit
-- 			      precision of zero).
-- 			      For x and X conversions, a non-zero result has
-- 			      the string "0x" (or "0X" for X conversions)
-- 			      prepended to it.
--
-- 		    0 (zero)  Zero padding.  For all conversions the converted
-- 			      value is padded on the left with zeros rather
-- 			      than blanks.  If a precision is given with a
-- 			      numeric conversion (d, o, x, and X), the 0 flag
-- 			      is ignored.
--
-- 		    -	      A negative field width flag; the converted value
-- 			      is to be left adjusted on the field boundary.
-- 			      The converted value is padded on the right with
-- 			      blanks, rather than on the left with blanks or
-- 			      zeros.  A - overrides a 0 if both are given.
--
-- 		    ' ' (space)  A blank should be left before a positive
-- 			      number produced by a signed conversion (d).
--
-- 		    +	      A sign must always be placed before a number
-- 			      produced by a signed conversion.  A + overrides
-- 			      a space if both are used.
--
-- 		field-width
-- 			An optional decimal digit string specifying a minimum
-- 			field width.  If the converted value has fewer bytes
-- 			than the field width, it will be padded with spaces on
-- 			the left (or right, if the left-adjustment flag has
-- 			been given) to fill out the field width.
--
-- 		.precision
-- 			An optional precision, in the form of a period '.'
-- 			followed by an optional digit string.  If the digit
-- 			string is omitted, the precision is taken as zero.
-- 			This gives the minimum number of digits to appear for
-- 			d, o, x, and X conversions, or the maximum number of
-- 			bytes to be printed from a string for s conversions.
-- 			For floating point it is the number of digits after
-- 			the decimal point.
--
-- 		type
-- 			A character that specifies the type of conversion to
-- 			be applied, see below.
--
-- 		A field width or precision, or both, may be indicated by an
-- 		asterisk '*' instead of a digit string.  In this case, a
-- 		Number argument supplies the field width or precision.  A
-- 		negative field width is treated as a left adjustment flag
-- 		followed by a positive field width; a negative precision is
-- 		treated as though it were missing.  Example: >
-- 			:echo printf("%d: %.*s", nr, width, line)
-- <		This limits the length of the text used from "line" to
-- 		"width" bytes.
--
-- 		The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
--
-- 				*printf-d* *printf-b* *printf-B* *printf-o* *printf-x* *printf-X*
-- 		dbBoxX	The Number argument is converted to signed decimal (d),
-- 			unsigned binary (b and B), unsigned octal (o), or
-- 			unsigned hexadecimal (x and X) notation.  The letters
-- 			"abcdef" are used for x conversions; the letters
-- 			"ABCDEF" are used for X conversions.  The precision, if
-- 			any, gives the minimum number of digits that must
-- 			appear; if the converted value requires fewer digits, it
-- 			is padded on the left with zeros.  In no case does a
-- 			non-existent or small field width cause truncation of a
-- 			numeric field; if the result of a conversion is wider
-- 			than the field width, the field is expanded to contain
-- 			the conversion result.
-- 			The 'h' modifier indicates the argument is 16 bits.
-- 			The 'l' modifier indicates the argument is 32 bits.
-- 			The 'L' modifier indicates the argument is 64 bits.
-- 			Generally, these modifiers are not useful. They are
-- 			ignored when type is known from the argument.
--
-- 		i	alias for d
-- 		D	alias for ld
-- 		U	alias for lu
-- 		O	alias for lo
--
-- 							*printf-c*
-- 		c	The Number argument is converted to a byte, and the
-- 			resulting character is written.
--
-- 							*printf-s*
-- 		s	The text of the String argument is used.  If a
-- 			precision is specified, no more bytes than the number
-- 			specified are used.
-- 			If the argument is not a String type, it is
-- 			automatically converted to text with the same format
-- 			as ":echo".
-- 							*printf-S*
-- 		S	The text of the String argument is used.  If a
-- 			precision is specified, no more display cells than the
-- 			number specified are used.
--
-- 							*printf-f* *E807*
-- 		f F	The Float argument is converted into a string of the
-- 			form 123.456.  The precision specifies the number of
-- 			digits after the decimal point.  When the precision is
-- 			zero the decimal point is omitted.  When the precision
-- 			is not specified 6 is used.  A really big number
-- 			(out of range or dividing by zero) results in "inf"
-- 			 or "-inf" with %f (INF or -INF with %F).
-- 			 "0.0 / 0.0" results in "nan" with %f (NAN with %F).
-- 			Example: >
-- 				echo printf("%.2f", 12.115)
-- <				12.12
-- 			Note that roundoff depends on the system libraries.
-- 			Use |round()| when in doubt.
--
-- 							*printf-e* *printf-E*
-- 		e E	The Float argument is converted into a string of the
-- 			form 1.234e+03 or 1.234E+03 when using 'E'.  The
-- 			precision specifies the number of digits after the
-- 			decimal point, like with 'f'.
--
-- 							*printf-g* *printf-G*
-- 		g G	The Float argument is converted like with 'f' if the
-- 			value is between 0.001 (inclusive) and 10000000.0
-- 			(exclusive).  Otherwise 'e' is used for 'g' and 'E'
-- 			for 'G'.  When no precision is specified superfluous
-- 			zeroes and '+' signs are removed, except for the zero
-- 			immediately after the decimal point.  Thus 10000000.0
-- 			results in 1.0e7.
--
-- 							*printf-%*
-- 		%	A '%' is written.  No argument is converted.  The
-- 			complete conversion specification is "%%".
--
-- 		When a Number argument is expected a String argument is also
-- 		accepted and automatically converted.
-- 		When a Float or String argument is expected a Number argument
-- 		is also accepted and automatically converted.
-- 		Any other argument type results in an error message.
--
-- 							*E766* *E767*
-- 		The number of {exprN} arguments must exactly match the number
-- 		of "%" items.  If there are not sufficient or too many
-- 		arguments an error is given.  Up to 18 arguments can be used.

-- Set prompt callback for buffer {buf} to {expr}.  When {expr}
-- 		is an empty string the callback is removed.  This has only
-- 		effect if {buf} has 'buftype' set to "prompt".
--
-- 		The callback is invoked when pressing Enter.  The current

-- 		Unlike |function()|, {name} must be an existing user function.

-- Escape {string} for use as file name command argument.  All
-- 		characters that have a special meaning, such as '%' and '|'
-- 		are escaped with a backslash.
-- 		For most systems the characters escaped are
-- 		" \t\n*?[{`$\\%#'\"|!<".  For systems where a backslash
-- 		appears in a filename, it depends on the value of 'isfname'.
-- 		A leading '+' and '>' is also escaped (special after |:edit|
-- 		and |:write|).  And a "-" by itself (special after |:cd|).
-- 		Example: >
-- 			:let fname = '+some str%nge|name'
-- 			:exe "edit " . fnameescape(fname)
-- <		results in executing: >
-- 			edit \+some\ str\%nge\|name
--- @return string
function vim.fn.fnameescape(fname) end

-- When {text} is a |List|: Append each item of the |List| as a
-- 		text line below line {lnum} in the current buffer.
-- 		Otherwise append {text} as one text line below line {lnum} in
-- 		the current buffer.
-- 		{lnum} can be zero to insert a line before the first one.
-- 		Returns 1 for failure ({lnum} out of range or out of memory),
-- 		0 for success.  Example: >
-- 			:let failed = append(line('$'), "# THE END")
-- 			:let failed = append(0, ["Chapter 1", "the beginning"])

-- Interrupt script execution.  It works more or less like the
-- 		user typing CTRL-C, most commands won't execute and control
-- 		returns to the user.  This is useful to abort execution
-- 		from lower down, e.g. in an autocommand.  Example: >
-- 		:function s:check_typoname(file)
-- 		:   if fnamemodify(a:file, ':t') == '['
-- 		:       echomsg 'Maybe typo'
-- 		:       call interrupt()
-- 		:   endif
-- 		:endfunction
-- 		:au BufWritePre * call s:check_typoname(expand('<amatch>'))
--- @return none
function vim.fn.interrupt() end

-- Execute {command} and capture its output.
-- 		If {command} is a |String|, returns {command} output.
-- 		If {command} is a |List|, returns concatenated outputs.
-- 		Examples: >
-- 			echo execute('echon "foo"')
-- <			foo >
-- 			echo execute(['echon "foo"', 'echon "bar"'])
-- <			foobar
--
-- 		The optional {silent} argument can have these values:
-- 			""		no `:silent` used
-- 			"silent"	`:silent` used
-- 			"silent!"	`:silent!` used
-- 		The default is "silent".  Note that with "silent!", unlike
-- 		`:redir`, error messages are dropped.
--
-- 		To get a list of lines use |split()| on the result: >
-- 			split(execute('args'), "\n")
--
-- <		This function is not available in the |sandbox|.
-- 		Note: If nested, an outer execute() will not observe output of
-- 		the inner calls.
-- 		Note: Text attributes (highlights) are not captured.
--- @return string
function vim.fn.execute(command) end

-- Like |screenchar()|, but return the attribute.  This is a rather
-- 		arbitrary number that can only be used to compare to the
-- 		attribute at other positions.
--- @return number
function vim.fn.screenattr(row, col) end

-- Call function {func} with the items in |List| {arglist} as
-- 		arguments.
-- 		{func} can either be a |Funcref| or the name of a function.
-- 		a:firstline and a:lastline are set to the cursor line.
-- 		Returns the return value of the called function.
-- 		{dict} is for functions with the "dict" attribute.  It will be
-- 		used to set the local variable "self". |Dictionary-function|
--- @param dict dictionary
function vim.fn.call(func, arglist, dict) end

-- The result is a Number, which is the character at position
-- 		[row, col] on the screen.  This works for every possible
-- 		screen position, also status lines, window separators and the
-- 		command line.  The top left position is row one, column one
-- 		The character excludes composing characters.  For double-byte
-- 		encodings it may only be the first byte.
-- 		This is mainly to be used for testing.
-- 		Returns -1 when row or col is out of range.
