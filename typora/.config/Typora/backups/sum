Your use of this software is subject to the End User\nLicense Agreement, Terms of Use and Privacy Policy at these URLs:\n\n* [https://www.speedtest.net/about/eula](https://www.speedtest.net/about/eula)\n* [https://www.speedtest.net/about/terms](https://www.speedtest.net/about/terms)\n* [https://www.speedtest.net/about/privacy](https://www.speedtest.net/about/privacy)\n\n## Output\nUpon successful execution, the application will exit with an exit code of 0. The result will include\nlatency, jitter, download, upload, packet loss (where available), and a result URL.\n\nLatency and jitter will be represented in milliseconds. Download and upload units will depend on the output\nformat as well as if a unit was specified. The human-readable format defaults to Mbps and any machine-readable\nformats (csv, tsv, json, jsonl, json-pretty) use bytes as the unit of measure with max precision. Packet loss is represented as a percentage, or **Not available** when packet loss is unavailable in the executing network environment.\n\nThe Result URL is available to share your result, appending **.png** to the Result URL will create a\nshareable result image.\n\n*Example human-readable result:*\n\n```\n$ speedtest\n    Speedtest by Ookla\n\n     Server: Speedtest.net - New York, NY (id = 10390)\n        ISP: Comcast Cable\n    Latency:    57.81 ms   (3.65 ms jitter)\n   Download:    76.82 Mbps (data used: 80.9 MB)\n     Upload:    37.58 Mbps (data used: 65.3 MB)\nPacket Loss:     0.0%\n Result URL: https://www.speedtest.net/result/c/8ae1200c-e639-45e5-8b55-41421a079250\n```\n\n## Network Timeout Values\nBy default, network requests set a timeout of **10** seconds. The only exception to this\nis latency testing, which sets a timeout of **15** seconds.\n\n## Fatal Errors\nUpon fatal errors, the application will exit with a non-zero exit code.\n\n**Initialization Fatal Error Examples:**\n\n*Configuration - Couldn't connect to server (Network is unreachable)*\n\n*Configuration - Could not retrieve or read configuration (ConfigurationError)*\n\n**Stage Execution Fatal Error Example:**\n\n*[error] Error: [1] Latency test failed for HTTP*\n\n*[error] Error: [36] Cannot open socket: Operation now in progress*\n\n*[error] Failed to resolve host name. Cancelling test suite.*\n\n*[error] Host resolve failed: Exec format error*\n\n*[error] Cannot open socket: No route to host*\n\n*[error] Server Selection - Failed to find a working test server. (NoServers)*\n\n## SSL Certificate Locations\nBy default the following paths are checked for CA certificate bundles on linux machines:\n\n    /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt\n    /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt\n    /usr/share/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt\n    /usr/local/share/certs/ca-root-nss.crt\n    /etc/ssl/cert.pem\n\nIf the device under test does *not* have one of the above mentioned files, then the canonical and up to date CA certificate bundle provided by the curl project can be manually\ndownloaded into a specific location.  This specific location can be provided as a parameter per the following example:\n\n    wget https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem\n    ./ookla --ca-certificate=./cacert.pem\n\n## Release Notes\n\n### 1.0.0 - 10/29/2019\n* Initial release\n\n## Copyright Notices for Third-Party Products/Libraries\nThis software incorporates free and open source third-party libraries, including:\n\n* [boost](https://www.boost.org/)\n* [libcurl](https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/)\n* [petopt](https://www.lysator.liu.se/~pen/petopt/)\n* [mbed TLS](https://tls.mbed.org/)\n* [ca-certificates extract](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html)\n* [L.
