default_orientation horizontal|vertical|auto
	Sets the default container layout for tiled containers.

include <path>
	Includes another file from path. path can be either a full path or a path relative to the parent con‚Äê
	fig, and expands shell syntax (see wordexp(3) for details). The same include file can only be included
	once; subsequent attempts will be ignored.

swaybg_command <command>
	Executes custom background command. Default is swaybg. Refer to sway-output(5) for more information.
	It can be disabled by setting the command to a single dash: swaybg_command -

swaynag_command <command>
	Executes custom command for swaynag. Default is swaynag. Additional arguments may be appended to the
	end. This should only be used to either direct sway to call swaynag from a custom path or to provide
	additional arguments. This should be placed at the top of the config for the best results.
	It can be disabled by setting the command to a single dash: swaynag_command -

workspace_layout default|stacking|tabbed
	Specifies the initial layout for new containers in an empty workspace.

xwayland enable|disable|force
	Enables or disables Xwayland support, which allows X11 applications to be used. enable will lazily
	load Xwayland so Xwayland will not be launched until the first client attempts to connect. In some
	cases, such as slower machines, it may be desirable to have Xwayland started immediately by using
	force instead of enable.
